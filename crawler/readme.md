In this folder you'll find four different crawlers.

oculusCrawler.py - The original Selenium powered web crawler. No longer works due to Oculus automatically blocking it.
oculusGraphCrawler.py - The new Graph API based crawler. Works until Oculus decides you've crawled enough with the current token.
steamCrawler.py - The Steam website-based crawler. Has worked without issues since day 1.
viveCrawler.py - An experimental Vive store based crawler. I dropped this project due to a lack of interest in this store.
